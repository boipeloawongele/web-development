        <h1>Key Parts of Web Development:</h1>
        <section>
            <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
            <p>This is what users see and interact with. It involves:
                
                HTML:The structure and content of the web page.
                
                CSS:The style and layout of the page (colors, fonts, spacing).
                
                JavaScript:Adds interactivity like sliders, menus, animations, and form validation.</section>
                
                <section><h4>Backend Development</h4>
                This is the behind-the-scenes part that handles data, servers, and application logic. Common technologies include:
                
                Languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, and Java.
                
                Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
                
                Servers that run the backend code and manage requests.</section>
                
               <section><h4>Full Stack Development</h4>
                A combination of both frontend and backend development. Full stack developers work on all aspects of a web application.
                
                Web Design vs Web Development
                Web design is about the look and feel (UI/UX), while web development is about turning those designs into working websites.</section>
