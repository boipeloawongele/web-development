        <h1>HTML WITH EXTERNAL CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular element or 
            groups of elements on your web page.
            <br> In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. <br>
             selects the HTML elements that we are going to style.</p>
             <div>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</div>
