        <h1>HTML WITH EXTERNAL CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular element or groups of elements on your web page.<br> In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector.<br> This selects the HTML elements that we are going to style.</p>
